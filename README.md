# Cloud Resume Challenge

This is my take on the [Cloud Resume Challenge](https://cloudresumechallenge.dev/), built to demonstrate my foundational skills in cloud and DevOps.

## 🌐 Live Site

## 📈 Visitor Counter

The site uses:
- **AWS Lambda** to update visitor count
- **DynamoDB** to store and increment visits
- **API Gateway** to expose the Lambda as an HTTP endpoint
- **JavaScript** to fetch and display the visitor count

## ⚙️ Tech Stack

- AWS S3 (Static Website Hosting)
- AWS Lambda (Python)
- AWS API Gateway

- JavaScript / HTML / CSS
- GitHub (Source control and portfolio)

## 🧠 What I Learned
